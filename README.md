PLATTE RIVER RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM (PRRIP -OR- Program)
Data Analysis Outline—Quantifying Effects of Predation on Piping Plover Productivity 
and Evaluating Effectiveness of Predator Management

The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program’s (PRRIP or Program) management 
objective for the piping plover (Charadrius melodus; hereafter plover) is to improve 
plover productivity along the central Platte River.  Plover fledge ratios 
(chicks fledged per estimated breeding pair) are highly variable among years.  
In 2018 and 2019, estimated plover fledge ratios reached the lowest values observed 
during 2010–2019.  In response, Program stakeholders prioritized learning about the 
impact of predation and our ability to mitigate those impacts at off-channel sand 
and water (OCSW) nesting sites. Two of the Program Extension Science Plan’s 
(PRRIP 2022a) Big Questions involve the role of predation on plover productivity.  
Extension Big Question (EBQ) No. 8 asks: “how much of an effect does predation 
have on plover productivity?” (PRRIP 2022a).  Associated learning objectives 
for EBQ No. 8 include: 

(1) quantifying the impact of predation on plover productivity; 
(2) identifying predator species responsible for losses; 
(3) determining when losses occur (i.e., incubation; brood rearing); 
and (4) using population models to predict the effect of decreasing fledge 
ratios due to predation (PRRIP 2022a).  

EBQ No. 9 queries: “how effective is Program management at mitigating losses of 
plover productivity due to predation?” (PRRIP 2022a).  Associated learning 
objectives for EBQ No. 9 include: 

(1) evaluating the effectiveness of trapping, fencing, and deterrent lighting 
at reducing nest and brood failure due to predation; (2) developing predator 
management alternatives based on learning through remote camera monitoring; 
and (3) evaluating the necessity for additional predator management actions 
based on plover response to predation over time (PRRIP 2022a).  Herein, we 
provide a summary of the data collected to answer these EBQs and an outline of 
data analysis approaches to quantifiably address the questions.
