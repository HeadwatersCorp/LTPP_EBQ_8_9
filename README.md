## 🎯 Project Background

The **PRRIP** aims to improve the reproductive success of **piping plovers** (*Charadrius melodus*) along the central Platte River. In recent years, particularly **2018–2019**, plover fledge ratios (chicks fledged per breeding pair) reached record lows. In response, stakeholders prioritized understanding:

- The extent to which **predation affects plover productivity**
- Whether **predator management practices** are effective at reducing those impacts

This work is structured around **Extension Big Questions 8 and 9** from the PRRIP Extension Science Plan (PRRIP 2022a).

## ❓ Big Questions

### 🐣 EBQ 8: *"How much of an effect does predation have on plover productivity?"*

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Quantify the impact of predation on nest and brood productivity  
2. Identify predator species responsible for losses  
3. Determine the timing of losses (e.g., incubation, brood-rearing)  
4. Use population models to predict long-term impacts of reduced productivity

### 🛡️ EBQ 9: *"How effective is Program management at mitigating losses due to predation?"*

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of trapping, fencing, and deterrent lighting  
2. Develop management strategies based on camera monitoring  
3. Assess long-term needs for predator management using observed plover responses

## 🧪 Data Analysis Approach

We outline statistical and modeling approaches to:
- Quantify nest fate probabilities using **Bayesian Logistic Exposure Models**
- Analyze BACI-style treatment effects for predator management
- Integrate productivity metrics into population models for predictive inference

All analysis scripts are reproducible and organized within the `scripts/` folder.
